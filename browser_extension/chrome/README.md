Small app that can open images with annotations yet to be validated.

## Setup
Got to chrome://extensions/ and click "Load Unpacked" and select the this folder. This should install the extension. You then need to add your api key and the number of tabs that should be opened at once in the options menu. When you pin the extension you can open the tabs by clicking the extension button.
