# How to add data
You can use the scripts in the logcrawler folder to ingest data. The scripts expect filesystem access to the logs and they also expect a certain structure. Also some of the scripts require that other scripts ran before. Read the readme there for me information. 

If you are not a member of the Berlin United RoboCup Team you won't have direct file system access to the log. You can however download all the files from logs.naoth.de and use the data from there. This is only useful when you want to add data that is not already in the live version.

## Use DB Backup
We provide database backups from the live version you could use in your local version. That saves you the time of inputing the data manually.
