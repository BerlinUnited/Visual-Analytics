# How to use this tool
While this tool supports labeling our recorded robocup images it is not primarily designed for this. Instead it is expected to be mainly used via the API. Only the validation and correction of annotations is done manually.

## Validation
TODO: describe how to create frame filters

You can also log into the admin panel and see all the annotations and their validation status. If you have the [clickable links extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/emgfgmngdnnipikijedfjflafkjkpfln?utm_source=item-share-cb) installed you can directly click the link to the annotation view showing this annotation and validate there.
